/**
 * This function allows to obtain the current continuation instance inside suspend functions and either suspend
 * currently running  coroutine or return result immediately without suspension.
 * This function can be used in a tail-call position as the return value of another suspend function.
 *
 * If the [body] returns the special [SUSPENDED_COMPUTATION] value, it means that suspend function did suspend the execution and will
 * not return any result immediately. In this case, the [Continuation] provided to the [body] shall be invoked at some moment in the future when
 * the result becomes available to resume the computation.
 *
 * Otherwise, the return value of the [body] must have a type assignable to [T] and represents the result of this suspend function.
 * It means that the execution was not suspended and the [Continuation] provided to the [body] shall not be invoked.
 * As the result type of the [body] is declared as `Any?` and cannot be correctly type-checked,
 * its proper return type remains on the conscience of the suspend function's author.
 *
 * Note that it is not recommended to call either [Continuation.resume] nor [Continuation.resumeWithException] functions synchronously in
 * the same stackframe where suspension function is run. They should be called asynchronously either later in the same thread or
 * from a different thread of execution.
 * Repeated invocation of any resume function on continuation produces unspecified behavior.
 * Use [runWithCurrentContinuation] as a safer way to obtain current continuation instance.
